This is a vagrant recipe for spinning up a 3 machine cluster using Neo4j 2.2 with the Open JDK.

Just type:

```
vagrant up
```

And you're good to go!

The Neo4j browser for each of the machines will be available locally at:

* [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001)
* [http://localhost:7002](http://localhost:7002)
* [http://localhost:7003](http://localhost:7003)

Any problems, let me know in the issues.
